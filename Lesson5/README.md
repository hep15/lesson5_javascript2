### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned if/else statements execute only one or the other statements, depending on whether true or false.
2. I also learned there are three types of loop statements:
– while statements
– do/while statements
– for statements
3. Finally, I learned that a while loops will iterate until the rule in the while isn't true. For statements will continue until the number is no longer smaller or larger than the number provided.
